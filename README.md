Any problem contact admin email : onlinefunservice365@gmail.com

Here’s how we can design it step by step:


---

🔹 App Structure

1. Home Page

Top corner: App name → Online Fun Service

Home page Big banner/photo → Attractive model photo + model name.

Sub header  → Login & Registration & admin Section 



---

2. Registration

Fields:

Full Name

Mobile Number

Password

Gender → (Male/Female)



👉 Logic:

If Male → goes to Normal User category

If Female → goes to Model category
After verified  & aprove by admin



---

3. Login

Two options in login system:

Model Login (female accounts) → Model Dashboard

User Login (male accounts) → User Dashboard


Password + Mobile Number authentication



---

4. Admin Login

Hidden/Unique Login Page (not on homepage, maybe at /admin-login)

Admin credentials only → go to Admin Dashboard



---

🔹 Dashboards

Normal User Dashboard

See list/grid of online models (photo + name + status)

Options:

Video Call button

Chat button
Gift 

Payment/Wallet (Add money, Pay per call/minute)

Afrer payment notification model and admin, and call back model


---

Model Dashboard

Upload section profile photo 
 More photos and video 

See list of users who want to connect

Accept/Reject call requests

Chat with users

Track earnings (payment system)



---

Admin Dashboard

Manage Models & Users

Monitor Calls/Chats

Payment Management (Stripe/UPI/QR code)

Block/Approve users

🔹 Core Features

1. Video Call System (WebRTC)

Peer-to-peer free call (no extra server cost except signaling).



2. Chat System (Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database)

Real-time text chat.



3. Payment Integration

Stripe/UPI/QR code → user adds money, spends per minute of call.



4. Wallet/Transaction System

Users recharge wallet.

Models earn from wallet balance.

Admin can withdraw/manage.





---

🔹 Tech Stack (Recommendation)

Frontend: React.js / Next.js / HTML-CSS-JS (basic version)

Backend: Node.js (Express) + Firebase / MongoDB

Authentication: Firebase Auth / JWT

Video Call: WebRTC + simple signaling server (Node.js + Socket.io)

Payment: Stripe / Razorpay / UPI QR



---

⚡ So the flow will look like:
Home → Register/Login → Dashboard (Model/User) → Call/Chat/Payment → Admin Control
